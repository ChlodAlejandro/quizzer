## Usage
Under `scripts/` is a `questions.js` file. Replace the contents of the arrays with your own questions. The contents of the array must be of the type `Question`, as declared in `objects/question.js`.

The website does not have a back-end, which means it's definitely easy to cheat with the developer tools, and its definitely easy to modify the questions. This is only good for use as a computer science project.

The fonts in this repository have been scrubbed to avoid copyright issues. The fonts used in the design files under `src/css` may not work.
